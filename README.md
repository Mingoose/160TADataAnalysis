# 160TADataAnalysis

These were some fun scripts I wrote using pandas. One of the scripts was an attempt to find the best puns you could make with TA names and pokemon names.
I did this by trying to find the largest matching substrings between TAs and pokemon. I also used a few other metrics.

The other script is a basic data analysis of office hours stats.
